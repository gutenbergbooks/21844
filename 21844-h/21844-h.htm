<h2>THE TALE OF TURKEY PROUDFOOT</h2>



<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<h3>A STRUTTER</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the hen turkeys thought Turkey
Proudfoot a wonderful creature. They
said he had the most beautiful tail on the
farm. When he spread it and strutted
about Farmer Green's place the hen
turkeys were sure to nudge one another
and say, "Ahem! Isn't he elegant?"</p>

<p>But the rest of the farmyard folk made
quite different remarks about him. They
declared Turkey Proudfoot to be a silly,
vain gobbler, noisy and quarrelsome.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_2" id="p_2">p. 2</a></span></p>

<p>Now, there was truth in what everybody
thought and said about this lordly person,
Turkey Proudfoot. He did have a huge
tail, when he chose to spread it; and his
feathers shone with a greenish, coppery,
bronzy glitter that might easily have
turned the head of anybody that boasted
such beautiful colors. Certainly the hen
turkeys turned their heads&mdash;and craned
their necks&mdash;whenever Turkey Proudfoot
came near them. And when he spoke to
them, saying "<i>Gobble, gobble, gobble!</i>" in
a loud tone, they were always pleased.</p>

<p>The hen turkeys seemed to find that
remark, "<i>Gobble, gobble, gobble!</i>" highly
interesting. But everybody else complained
about the noise that Turkey
Proudfoot made, and said that if he must
gobble they wished he would go off by himself,
where people didn't have to listen to
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_3" id="p_3">p. 3</a></span></p>

<p>And nobody but the hen turkeys liked
the way Turkey Proudfoot walked. At
every step he took he raised a foot high in
the air, acting for all the world as if the
ground wasn't good enough for him to
walk upon. And when he wasn't picking
up a seed, or a bit of grain, or an insect
off the ground, he held his head very high.
Often Turkey Proudfoot seemed to look
right past his farmyard neighbors, as if
he were gazing at something in the next
field and didn't see them. But they soon
learned that that was only an odd way of
his. Really, he saw about everything that
went on. If anybody happened to grin at
him Turkey Proudfoot was sure to take
notice at once and try to pick a quarrel.</p>

<p>After all, perhaps it wasn't strange that
Turkey Proudfoot should act as he did.
Being the ruler of Farmer Green's whole
flock of turkeys, he was somewhat spoiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_4" id="p_4">p. 4</a></span>
All the hen turkeys did about as he told
them to do. Or if they didn't, Turkey
Proudfoot thought that they obeyed his
orders. And the younger gobblers as
well had to mind him. If they didn't,
Turkey Proudfoot fought them until they
were ready to gobble for mercy.</p>

<p>Having whipped the younger gobblers a
good many times, Turkey Proudfoot
firmly believed that he could whip anything
or anybody. And there was nobody
on the farm, almost, at whom he hadn't
dashed at least once. He had even attacked
Farmer Green. But Farmer
Green quickly taught him better. A blow
on the head from a stout stick bowled
Turkey Proudfoot over and he never tried
to fight Farmer Green again.</p>

<p>That proved that Turkey Proudfoot
wasn't as empty-headed as some of his
neighbors thought him. It was possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_5" id="p_5">p. 5</a></span>
to get a lesson into his head, even if one
had to knock it into his skull with a club.</p>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_6" id="p_6">p. 6</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<h3>THE SILLY SIX</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Green</span> owned six geese. Though
there was an even number of them, they
were odd creatures. They had little to do
with the other farmyard folk, but kept
much to themselves. If one of them
started up the road on some errand, the
other five always followed her. If one of
them suddenly took it into her head to enjoy
a swim her five companions were sure
to want one too, and waddled with her to
the duck pond.</p>

<p>Now, Turkey Proudfoot never went
swimming. Like all the rest of the flock
over which he ruled, he thought swimming<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_7" id="p_7">p. 7</a></span>
was bad for one's health. He couldn't
understand how anybody could enjoy cold
water, except for drinking purposes.
And somehow he always felt as if his
feathers had been a bit ruffled whenever
he saw the six geese set out for the duck
pond. Although their taking a swim was
no affair of his, still it made him angry.</p>

<p>"Look at those geese!" he would gobble
angrily to anybody that happened to be
near him. "They're going to take another
cold, wet bath. They're old enough
to know better. I often wonder why
Farmer Green wants such a stupid crew
on his farm. The Silly Six, I call 'em!"</p>

<p>When Turkey Proudfoot talked in that
fashion there were some that didn't agree
with him. The ducks never failed to
quack their displeasure. And old Spot
sometimes growled and told him he'd be
the better for a good swim.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_8" id="p_8">p. 8</a></span></p>

<p>But Turkey Proudfoot always declared,
in answer to that, that he knew he'd catch
his death of cold if he ever stepped into
the duck pond. And there were some of
the same mind as he.</p>

<p>There was Miss Kitty Cat, who never
liked to get her feet wet and on stormy
days lay by the hour beneath the kitchen
stove and dozed.</p>

<p>And there was the rooster. He didn't
believe in wet, cold baths. He liked dry
dust baths. And when, one day, Turkey
Proudfoot turned to him suddenly and
gobbled, "There go the Silly Six to swim!"
the rooster answered with a sniff, "Well,
let 'em go! Don't stop 'em on my account.
I certainly don't want to join
them."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot was all ready for a
quarrel. "I hope you don't think <i>I</i> want
to go swimming with the geese," he retorted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_9" id="p_9">p. 9</a></span>
There was a dangerous glitter in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the rooster made haste to
assure Turkey Proudfoot that he meant
nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>"Don't let's quarrel!" the rooster cried&mdash;for
he was much smaller than Turkey
Proudfoot. "There's nothing for us to
quarrel about. We're of the same mind
about the geese and their swimming."</p>

<p>"I'm disappointed," Turkey Proudfoot
told him. "For a moment I thought
I had an excuse for fighting you. And
I'm not sure that I oughtn't to be angry
with you for agreeing with me when I
didn't expect you to."</p>

<p>The rooster gave a hoarse crow. He
thought Turkey Proudfoot was joking.
And being afraid of Turkey Proudfoot,
the rooster felt obliged to laugh loudly at
his jokes.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_10" id="p_10">p. 10</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't laugh at me!" Turkey Proudfoot
cried.</p>

<p>"C-c-can't I laugh at the six silly
geese?" the rooster stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Turkey Proudfoot. "Yes&mdash;if
you see anything funny about them.
For my part, I couldn't laugh at them if
I tried to. The mere thought of plunging
into cold water almost gives me a chill."</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h3>THE MEDDLER</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Why</span> don't you tell the geese that it's
dangerous for them to swim in the duck
pond?" the rooster asked Turkey Proudfoot.
"Tell them how it almost gives you
a chill just to see them set out for the
pond. Ask them to keep out of the water."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot drew himself up to
his full height, spread his tail, and
looked down at the rooster with great disdain.
"Ask!" he exclaimed. "I never
ask anything of anybody. I'll have you
know, sir, that I give orders. And when
I give 'em I expect folks to obey 'em."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_12" id="p_12">p. 12</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" cried the rooster gayly. He
was really shaking in his shoes and didn't
intend to let Turkey Proudfoot know it.
"Order the geese to stay away from the
water. Command them to stop swimming.
If you don't, you'll have a terrible chill
some day when you see them set out for
the duck pond. And you don't want to be
ill just before the holidays."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Turkey Proudfoot.
"I don't want to get a chill and be ill."
And then he turned suddenly upon the
startled rooster. "Look here!" cried
Turkey Proudfoot. "It seems to me that
<i>you</i> are giving <i>me</i> orders."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" the rooster assured him.
"No, indeed! You're mistaken."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me I'm mistaken!" Turkey
Proudfoot bawled in an angry, gobbly
voice. "I'm never mistaken."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly not!" said the rooster,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_13" id="p_13">p. 13</a></span>
who was bold as brass with most of his
neighbors, but very mild with Turkey
Proudfoot.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed.
"You're getting yourself into a hole, sir!
If I wasn't mistaken, then you <i>were</i> giving
me orders. And in either case I
should have to fight you."</p>

<p>This was too much for the rooster. He
couldn't grasp what Turkey Proudfoot
was saying. He only knew that things
looked bad for him because Turkey Proudfoot
was getting angrier every moment.</p>

<p>"I say!" the rooster cried. "Please
don't waste your time on me just now, Mr.
Turkey Proudfoot! Here come the six
silly geese back from the duck pond.
And I'd suggest that you speak to them
at once and warn them not to enter the
water again."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot glanced across the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_14" id="p_14">p. 14</a></span>
farmyard. It was as the rooster had said.
The six geese were waddling around a corner
of the barn in single file. Somehow
the sight of them made him so furious
that he forgot he had been picking a quarrel
with the rooster.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to them," he gobbled. "I'll
fix them. They'll be so scared that they
won't dare leave this yard again."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot hurried towards the
geese. He didn't take time to strut, but
ran across the yard with long strides.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly geese!" Turkey Proudfoot
called. "Keep away from the duck-pond!
The weather's getting colder every
day; and it makes me shiver to see you
start off for a swim."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot had supposed the six
geese would be very meek and most eager
to obey his commands. But to his great
surprise they stopped, wheeled about so<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_15" id="p_15">p. 15</a></span>
that they stood in a row, facing him, and
hissed loudly.</p>

<p>It was not at all the sort of answer Turkey
Proudfoot had expected.</p>

<h3>SCARING THE GEESE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> six geese stood in a row and hissed
at Turkey Proudfoot. He was so astonished
that any one of them could have
knocked him over with a feather, almost.
When he gobbled an order at them, telling
them not to go swimming again, the
geese hissed at him. That was just the
same as telling him to keep still and mind
his own affairs.</p>

<p>And Turkey Proudfoot was not used to
answers like that.</p>

<p>The rooster had followed him across the
farmyard in order to look on and listen
while Turkey Proudfoot spoke to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_17" id="p_17">p. 17</a></span>
geese. And his surprise was as great as
Turkey Proudfoot's.</p>

<p>"Surely!" he muttered to Turkey
Proudfoot, "you aren't going to let these
geese go unpunished. They've insulted
you."</p>

<p>"Ha! I <i>thought</i> they had," Turkey
Proudfoot exclaimed. "And I'm glad to
know that you agree with me. There's
no doubt that they deserve a severe beating."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the rooster cried. "Now we'll
see some fun."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Turkey Proudfoot. "I
expect we'll have a merry time." Still he
made no move to attack the geese, who
stood motionless, facing him like soldiers.</p>

<p>"Well!" the rooster said impatiently.
"Aren't you going to punish these geese?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" Turkey Proudfoot
cried. "Why did you tag after me across<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_18" id="p_18">p. 18</a></span>
the yard if it wasn't to fight them? I've
often heard that you were usually spoiling
for a fight. So here's your chance!"</p>

<p>It was true, in a way, that the rooster
was always ready to fight. Not one of the
cockerels on the farm dared to speak to
him. But he always took care to fight
only such as he knew he could whip. Certainly
he had no desire to fight six geese
all by himself. He drew back a little and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"This is not my quarrel," he declared.</p>

<p>"But you suggested it," Turkey Proudfoot
reminded him. "And now I suggest
that you take it up. I did my part. You
must do yours."</p>

<p>A wild look came into the rooster's eyes.
He wanted to run away. But he was a
proud bird. He thought a great deal of
the <i>looks</i> of things. And he didn't know
just what to do.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_19" id="p_19">p. 19</a></span></p>

<p>Then something happened that suddenly
made him act&mdash;and act quickly.
The six geese all took one step forward.</p>

<p>The rooster turned tail and dashed
around the barn, out of sight. And Turkey
Proudfoot found himself facing the
six geese, who soon took one more step
towards him and hissed louder than ever.</p>

<p>He had never felt so ill at ease in all his
life. But he remembered that he was the
ruler of the turkey flock and the handsomest
bird on the farm. It would never do
to have it said that he ran away from six
silly geese.</p>

<p>"I'll scare 'em," he thought. Thereupon
he burst into a deafening gobble and
took one step towards the geese.</p>

<p>He had fully expected to see them fall
back. What they actually did was most
annoying. Every one of them took another
step towards him.</p>

<h3>A SAFE PERCH</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Turkey Proudfoot faced the six geese
in the farmyard he began to feel that he
had made a great mistake in speaking to
them. Their hisses were far from agreeable.
They were even threatening.</p>

<p>"This will never do," Turkey Proudfoot
muttered to himself. "No doubt I
could whip all six of them; but they'd be
likely to pull some of my tail feathers out.
And I don't want my tail spoiled." For
a moment or two he didn't know what to
do. But suddenly an idea popped into his
head.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" he ordered the geese.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_21" id="p_21">p. 21</a></span>
And wheeling about, he marched off across
the farmyard.</p>

<p>The geese waddled after him.</p>

<p>Perched on top of a wagon wheel in
front of the barn, the rooster saw the odd
procession. And he gave voice loudly to
his delight.</p>

<p>"The geese are chasing Turkey Proudfoot!"
he crowed. He called to everybody
to hurry and see the fun. And all
the hens came a-running.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Turkey Proudfoot.
"I ordered the geese to follow me.
They're simply obeying orders." And he
strutted, a little faster than usual, toward
the tree near the farmhouse where he
roosted every night.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he cried to the geese when they
reached the tree. As he spoke, Turkey
Proudfoot flapped himself up and settled
on a low branch. At last he felt safe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_22" id="p_22">p. 22</a></span>
He knew that the geese wouldn't follow
him up there. With their webbed feet
they never roosted in trees.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hen turkeys had come
a-running too, from the meadow. They
wanted to see what was going on. And
they promptly fell into a loud dispute with
the rooster and the hens.</p>

<p>"He did!" the hens cackled, meaning
that Turkey Proudfoot had run away
from the geese.</p>

<p>"He didn't!" the hen turkeys squalled,
meaning that Turkey Proudfoot hadn't
been chased, but had <i>led</i> the geese across
the farmyard.</p>

<p>The six geese took no part in the quarrel.
They had driven Turkey Proudfoot
into the tree. And knowing that he
wouldn't come down so long as they
waited there, they marched off in single
file toward the duck pond.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_23" id="p_23">p. 23</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you going?" the rooster
asked them.</p>

<p>The leader of the geese turned her head
at him and hissed. And her five companions
turned their heads at him too, and
hissed likewise.</p>

<p>"I ordered them to go and have a
swim," Turkey Proudfoot cried from his
tree, as soon as the geese were out of hearing.
"I don't want them about the farmyard.
I haven't time to bother with them.
Besides, they're so stupid that I never
could teach them anything. I walked
ahead of them, across the farmyard, to
show them the stylish strut. But they
couldn't learn it. They'll waddle to the
end of their days."</p>

<p>"There!" cried the hen turkeys to the
hens. "You hear what he says. The
geese weren't chasing him. He was trying
to teach them to strut."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_24" id="p_24">p. 24</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh!" exclaimed Henrietta Hen, who
always spoke her mind right out. "Turkey
Proudfoot had better be careful.
Some day those geese will teach him how
to waddle."</p>

<h3>THE MIMIC</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Young</span> Master Meadow Mouse had often
peeped at Turkey Proudfoot from behind
a clump of grass, or a hill of corn. But
he had never dared show himself to Turkey
Proudfoot. Somehow the old gobbler
looked terribly fierce. And he was
so big that Master Meadow Mouse didn't
like the idea of even saying "Good day!"
to him. He had heard Turkey Proudfoot
spoken of as a "gobbler." Who knew but
that a gobbler would gobble up young
Master Meadow Mouse if he had a chance?</p>

<p>Unseen by everybody, Master Meadow
Mouse had watched the geese drive Turkey<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_26" id="p_26">p. 26</a></span>
Proudfoot across the farmyard and
seen him flapping up to roost in a tree out
of their reach. And though Turkey
Proudfoot strutted and tried to act very
lordly as he headed the procession across
the yard, Master Meadow Mouse had noticed
how Turkey Proudfoot kept a wary
eye on the geese behind him, and stepped
not quite so high as he usually did, but
further.</p>

<p>"Ho!" Master Meadow Mouse had
piped to himself in his thin voice. "Turkey
Proudfoot is not the brave fellow I
always thought him. He's afraid of
geese!"</p>

<p>From that moment Master Meadow
Mouse forgot his fear of Turkey Proudfoot.
Nobody stands in awe of a coward.
So the very next time that Master
Meadow Mouse saw Turkey Proudfoot
strutting in the yard he crept up behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_27" id="p_27">p. 27</a></span>
Turkey Proudfoot and tried to walk exactly
like him.</p>

<p>There were a good many farmyard fowls
scratching about the yard at the time,
and wishing to appear at his best, Turkey
Proudfoot spread his tail, puffed out
his chest, and strolled all around as if he&mdash;and
and not Farmer Green&mdash;owned the place.</p>

<p>Although Turkey Proudfoot seemed to
see none of his neighbors, nevertheless he
was watching them carefully out of the
corner of his eye, to see whether they were
noticing him.</p>

<p>They were. There was no doubt of
that.</p>

<p>Not only were they looking at him; they
were laughing at him as well.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot's face couldn't grow
red with rage. It was red already. It
was always red. Being very angry, he
gobbled at the giggling hens, at the rooster,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_28" id="p_28">p. 28</a></span>
even at old dog Spot, "Why are you
laughing at me?"</p>

<p>"We aren't!" they cried. "You've no
reason to be angry with us."</p>

<p>"'Tis well," said Turkey Proudfoot
with a toplofty toss of his bald head.
"Since you're not laughing at me, you
needn't laugh at all. I don't like your
sniggering."</p>

<p>"We can't help laughing," a few of the
more daring ones told him. "It's so
funny!"</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"He is!"</p>

<p>"Who is?"</p>

<p>"Master Meadow Mouse!"</p>

<p>"Master Meadow Mouse!" repeated
Turkey Proudfoot in a bewildered fashion.</p>

<p>He looked in front of him. He looked
to the left. He looked to the right. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_29" id="p_29">p. 29</a></span>
couldn't see Master Meadow Mouse anywhere.</p>

<p>"Look behind you!" cried Henrietta
Hen.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot turned his head.</p>

<p>"I don't see any Master Meadow
Mouse," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"How can you, when your tail's spread
like that?" Henrietta Hen asked him.
"Close up your tail and then you'll see
what we're laughing at."</p>

<p>But Turkey Proudfoot declined to do
anything of the sort.</p>

<p>"It's just a trick," he squalled.
"You're all jealous of me and my beautiful
tail. You don't want me to carry my
tail this way."</p>

<p>Behind Turkey Proudfoot's tail Master
Meadow Mouse did a very naughty thing.
He stuck out his tongue. And all the onlookers
shrieked with merriment.</p>

<h3>HALF WRONG</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was no wonder that Turkey Proudfoot
was angry. Everybody in the farmyard
was laughing and looking his way&mdash;or so
it seemed to him.</p>

<p>Since he couldn't see any joke, he decided
to leave his silly neighbors and go
off into the fields where he could be alone.
So he walked slowly away, holding his
head high and stepping in his most elegant
manner.</p>

<p>To his great disgust peals of laughter
followed him. And though he had intended
to march off without saying a word,
this last outburst so filled him with rage<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_31" id="p_31">p. 31</a></span>
that he couldn't resist spinning about to
glare and gobble at his tormentors.</p>

<p>He turned so quickly that he surprised
Master Meadow Mouse with one of his
tiny feet lifted high in the air. He surprised
him so much that Master Meadow
Mouse stood stock still and didn't even
bring his foot down, but held it off the
ground as if it had frozen stiff and couldn't
be moved.</p>

<p>At first there was a most joyful look on
Master Meadow Mouse's face. But it
faded instantly into one of doubt and dismay.
To tell the truth, Master Meadow
Mouse hadn't expected Turkey Proudfoot
to turn around and catch him right
in his mimicking act.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" cried Turkey Proudfoot.
"So it's you that they're laughing at, eh?"</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse was so upset that
he murmured faintly, "Yes, it's me."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_32" id="p_32">p. 32</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I don't blame them," said Turkey
Proudfoot. "You certainly look
very queer. Why are you holding your
foot off the ground like that?"</p>

<p>"I was in the midst of taking a step
when you turned around and startled me,"
Master Meadow Mouse explained. "And
I don't know whether to set my foot down
ahead of me, or to put it behind me."</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed!" Turkey Proudfoot
said. "I never fight folks of your
size. You're too little for me to pay much
attention to. I must say, however, that
you have a very odd way of walking."</p>

<p>By this time Master Meadow Mouse had
recovered from his surprise and wasn't
afraid in the least. Now he laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>"I was walking the way you walk," he
cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_33" id="p_33">p. 33</a></span>
"No, indeed! You certainly
weren't." He didn't ask Master Meadow
Mouse's pardon for contradicting.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know why I wasn't," Master
Meadow Mouse replied somewhat
hotly. "I was strutting right behind you,
all the way across the yard. That's why
everybody was giggling."</p>

<p>"It's no wonder they were poking fun
at you," Turkey Proudfoot told him.
"You amused the neighbors because you
thought you were strutting, while you
really weren't."</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse put his foot
down on the ground. He was puzzled.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I wasn't strutting,"
he retorted. "I was raising my feet just
as high as I could lift them."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes?" said Turkey Proudfoot.
"But you forgot one thing."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_34" id="p_34">p. 34</a></span></p>

<p>"You didn't spread your tail," Turkey
Proudfoot explained. "And that's half
of strutting."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't know it," Master Meadow
Mouse stammered. And then he darted
away, to hide in the grass beyond the
fence.</p>

<p>He felt much ashamed to have made
such a mistake.</p>

<h3>HARD TO PLEASE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was very hard to please Turkey Proudfoot.
To be sure, he always pleased himself.
But nothing anyone else did seemed
to suit him. And there was one thing
that always made him peevish. That was
the gobbling of the younger turkey cocks.</p>

<p>To anybody that wasn't a turkey, their
voices sounded just as sweet as Turkey
Proudfoot's. But he claimed that there
was something wrong with all gobbles except
his own. Either they were too loud
or too soft, too high or too low, too long
or too short. And whenever a young cock
gobbled in his hearing Turkey Proudfoot<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_36" id="p_36">p. 36</a></span>
was sure to rush up to him and order him
to keep still, for pity's sake!</p>

<p>They usually obeyed him. Not only
was Turkey Proudfoot the biggest gobbler
on the farm, but he had a fierce and lordly
look about him. It was a bold young turkey
cock that dared defy him. Once in a
while one of them foolishly ventured to
tell Turkey Proudfoot to mind his own affairs.
And then there was sure to be a
fight&mdash;a quick, short, noisy fray which
ended always in the same fashion, with
Turkey Proudfoot chasing the young cock
out of the farmyard.</p>

<p>Luckily for the youngsters, they could
run faster than he could, for they were
not nearly as heavy.</p>

<p>Although Turkey Proudfoot didn't like
to hear others gobble, nevertheless he enjoyed
the excuse for a fight that their gobbling
gave him. And when he had nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_37" id="p_37">p. 37</a></span>
more important to do he often stood
still and listened in the hope of hearing
some upstart gobbler testing his voice in
a neighboring field. Newly grown cocks
had to go a long way off to be safe from
Turkey Proudfoot's attacks.</p>

<p>One day in the middle of the summer
the lord of the turkey flock was feeding
behind the barn when a loud gobble
brought his head up with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Turkey Proudfoot cried.
"That's somebody in the yard, around the
barn. He thinks I'm further away than
this, or he'd never dare bawl like that."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot dashed around the
barn at a swift trot. He was surprised
to see not a turkey cock in the farmyard.
The rooster was there, however. And
Turkey Proudfoot eyed him sternly.</p>

<p>"You weren't trying to gobble a moment
ago, were you?" he inquired.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_38" id="p_38">p. 38</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed!" said the rooster.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Somebody gobbled," he declared.
"I'm sure the noise came from this yard.
I was behind the barn when I heard it.
And I hurried around the corner at once."</p>

<p>"Maybe the person that gobbled ran
around the other end of the barn, to dodge
you," the rooster suggested.</p>

<p>"I'll go and see," said Turkey Proudfoot.
And he went back where he came
from.</p>

<p>He found nobody there. But that annoying
gobble sounded again and brought
him back into the yard even faster than
before. "Who did that?" he squalled.</p>

<p>And somebody mocked him. Somebody
repeated his question after him. It
was the same voice that had gobbled.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot's rage was terrible
to see.</p>

<h3>A STRANGE GOBBLE</h3>


<p>"<i><span class="smcap">Gobble</span>, gobble, gobble, gobble!</i>"</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot stood in the farmyard
and craned his neck in every direction.
That sound certainly was close at
hand. Yet there wasn't a turkey cock
anywhere in sight, either on the ground
or in the trees.</p>

<p>Just for a moment Turkey Proudfoot
was worried.</p>

<p>"That wasn't <i>my</i> gobble, was it?" he
asked the rooster. "If I gobbled, I didn't
know it."</p>

<p>"No! You didn't gobble," said the
rooster, "though I must say that gobbling<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_40" id="p_40">p. 40</a></span>
sounded a good deal like yours."</p>

<p>"<i>Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble!</i>"</p>

<p>"There it goes again!" cried Turkey
Proudfoot. He was almost frantic.
"How can I fight that fellow if I can't see
him?" he cried. He looked up at the roof
of the barn; but there was no one there except
the gilded rooster that told which
way the wind blew. He looked up at the
roof of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose that fellow's hiding
in the chimney, do you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No doubt he is," said the rooster. "If
I were you I'd fly up there and catch him."</p>

<p>"The roof's high for one of my weight
to fly to," Turkey Proudfoot remarked.</p>

<p>"Still, I could flap up to the top of the
woodshed and get to the roof of the
house from there.... I'll take a look
and see how high the house seems when
I'm near it."</p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_41" id="p_41">p. 41</a></span></p>

<p>To the rooster's delight, Turkey Proudfoot
started towards the house. The rooster
promptly called to all the hens to
"come quick," because Turkey Proudfoot
was going to fly to the roof of the
farmhouse. "I hope he won't get into
trouble," said the rooster with a chuckle.
"It would be a pity if he fell down the
chimney."</p>

<p>In spite of his words, the rooster didn't
look at all uneasy. Indeed, the only thing
that worried him was the fear that Turkey
Proudfoot <i>wouldn't</i> get himself into a
scrape. But he thought it more polite not
to say exactly what he hoped.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot stalked up to the
farmhouse and stopped near the piazza.
He was gazing upwards and measuring the
height of the roof with his eye when all at
once a loud "<i>Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble!</i>"
almost tipped him over backward.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_42" id="p_42">p. 42</a></span></p>

<p>The outcry came from the farmhouse.
There was no doubt of that. But it didn't
come from the roof, nor the chimney.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot stared at the windows
and the doors and saw no one except
Miss Kitty Cat, dozing on a window sill.
Then something moved beneath the piazza
ceiling. It was a cage, which swayed as
a green figure clung to the wires on one
side of it.</p>

<p>"I'm a handsome bird," a voice informed
Turkey Proudfoot. "<i>Gobble,
gobble, gobble, gobble!</i>"</p>

<p>For once in his life Turkey Proudfoot
hadn't a word to say. For the moment he
was struck dumb.</p>

<p>At last he found his voice. "Who are
you?" he bellowed.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Don't laugh at me!" cried Turkey
Proudfoot.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_43" id="p_43">p. 43</a></span></p>

<p>"Polly wants a cracker," said the green
bird.</p>

<p>A few quick steps brought Turkey
Proudfoot upon the piazza, nearer the
cage where the annoying green person
swung and made queer, throaty noises&mdash;sounds
which only angered Turkey Proud
foot the more.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot took a little run and
rose into the air, to crash against the cage
and then fall flapping upon the piazza
floor.</p>

<p>The green person shrieked. And the
hired man, with an axe in his hand,
peered out of the woodshed door.</p>

<p>"Here, you old gobbler! You leave
our Polly alone!" he called. And he ran
out and gave Turkey Proudfoot a sharp
rap with the axe helve.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot ran off and hid behind
the barn and sulked.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_44" id="p_44">p. 44</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a bird around here," he muttered,
"that mocks Miss Kitty Cat; and
they call him a Cat Bird. Now, here's a
bird that mocks me; so I should think
they'd call him a Turkey Bird. But they
don't. I heard the hired man call him
Pretty Polly.</p>

<p>"Pretty Polly indeed!" Turkey Proudfoot
sniffed. "That creature is nothing
but a bunch of green feathers and a loud
voice."</p>

<h3>THE WORM TURNS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Henrietta Hen</span> had no love for Turkey
Proudfoot. Beginning with the days of
her chickenhood he had always ordered
her about, telling her not to do this and
not to do that. Even after she was grown
up and had a family of her own, Turkey
Proudfoot treated her as if she had just
begun to scratch for herself.</p>

<p>If Henrietta Hen found a spot where
somebody had spilled a few kernels of
corn Turkey Proudfoot was more than
likely to rush up to her and cry, "Go
away! I've had my eye on that corn for
some time. I saw it first."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_46" id="p_46">p. 46</a></span></p>

<p>On such occasions there was nothing
Henrietta Hen could do except to stand
aside and look on while Turkey Proudfoot
ate the corn. He was so much bigger
than she that he could bowl her over
easily.</p>

<p>On her own account Henrietta didn't
really think it worth while to try to make
any trouble for Turkey Proudfoot. But
when she led her first brood of chicks into
the yard to teach them to find food for
themselves, Turkey Proudfoot's lordly
ways made her very angry.</p>

<p>"Move your family over on the gravel
drive!" Turkey Proudfoot ordered her.</p>

<p>Henrietta Hen said flatly that she
wouldn't.</p>

<p>"There are no bugs&mdash;no worms&mdash;in the
gravel," she told him. "My chicks have
a right to go anywhere on this farm."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot looked at her in<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_47" id="p_47">p. 47</a></span>
amazement. Never before had Henrietta
Hen spoken to him in such a way.</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity!" he exclaimed. "Aren't
you forgetting your manners, Henrietta?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not!" she snapped. "I've
stood too much from you all my life. I
warn you now that the worm has turned."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot glanced quickly
down at the ground.</p>

<p>"Where's the worm?" he asked.
"Point him out to me before he gets
away."</p>

<p>"There!" cried Henrietta Hen.
"That's just like you. If anybody spies
a worm, you think you ought to have it."</p>

<p>"Come! come!" Turkey Proudfoot
coaxed her. "Don't let's quarrel over a
mere trifle such as a worm. Just you
show me where you saw him turn and I'll
show you how to snatch a worm up in the
neatest and quickest fashion."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_48" id="p_48">p. 48</a></span></p>

<p>Henrietta Hen tossed her handsome
head.</p>

<p>"The worm I was talking about is right
before you," she sniffed. "If you can't
see it, I shan't help you."</p>

<p>Of course she had been talking of herself
when she remarked that the worm
had turned. She had meant that she had
always allowed Turkey Proudfoot to treat
her like a worm under his feet. But at
last she had made up her mind that he
shouldn't order her about any longer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Turkey Proudfoot was fast
losing his temper.</p>

<p>"You've caused me to lose a fine, fat
worm; and you shall suffer for it!" he
scolded. "The only thing for you to do
is to offer me a fine, fat chick in its place."</p>

<p>At that Henrietta Hen set up a great
clamor.</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the sort!" she<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_49" id="p_49">p. 49</a></span>
shrieked. And then she screamed for the
rooster. "Come quick, Mr. Rooster!
Help! Help!"</p>

<h3>BLUSTER</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after Henrietta Hen shrieked for
the rooster he came hurrying around a
corner of the barn. When he saw Turkey
Proudfoot towering above Henrietta and
her new brood of chicks in the middle of
the farmyard he stopped short. To tell
the truth, the rooster was afraid of Turkey
Proudfoot and usually took pains to
keep out of his way.</p>

<p>"Go back!" Turkey Proudfoot called
to him. "You're not needed here.
There's been a little difficulty; but I can
settle it myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well!" the rooster replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_51" id="p_51">p. 51</a></span>
"I'm glad there's no great trouble.
When I heard Henrietta calling me I
thought she was in danger." He turned,
then, to slink away behind the barn.</p>

<p>"Don't desert me!" Henrietta Hen besought
him. "Help! Help!"</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot waved a wing at the
rooster.</p>

<p>"Don't pay any attention to her!" he
said. "She's excited. I'll have her
calmed down in no time."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm excited!" Henrietta
Hen cried. "Don't let him deceive you,
Mr. Rooster! He's been threatening
me!"</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot bade her, in an undertone,
to be quiet.</p>

<p>"Go along about your business," he
told the rooster. "She's mistaken. I
haven't said I'd harm her."</p>

<p>"No! But he's talking about eating<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_52" id="p_52">p. 52</a></span>
one of my chicks! And that's worse,"
Henrietta screamed. "If you're as
brave as I always supposed, Mr. Rooster,
you'll defend my family."</p>

<p>Although the rooster was terribly
frightened, and wanted to run away, he
simply couldn't desert Henrietta Hen.</p>

<p>"She's a nuisance," he muttered as he
marched across the farmyard. "I don't
see why she wanted to bring her chicks
out here where Turkey Proudfoot would
see them. She's landed me in a scrape.
There won't be much left of me when that
old gobbler gets through with me."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the rooster put on a bold
front. Drawing himself up to look his
tallest, he glared at Turkey Proudfoot
and said shrilly, "What do you mean by
annoying this lady?"</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot gulped. He wondered
what had come over his neighbors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_53" id="p_53">p. 53</a></span>
The rooster had always acted afraid of
him. Though small, the rooster was
strongly built. And he had a sharp bill
and sharp spurs, too. Turkey Proudfoot
noted these details carefully.</p>

<p>"I won't have to fight him," he thought.
"I'll behave so fiercely that the rooster
will be glad to run off. And then I'll run
after him so folks will think I am chasing
him."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot then began to
bluster. He gobbled loudly, without saying
anything at all. He even made a few
quick passes at the rooster with his bill.</p>

<p>To his dismay, the rooster merely
dodged. He didn't turn tail and run, as
Turkey Proudfoot had hoped he would.</p>

<p>"I'll have to try something else,"
Turkey Proudfoot said to himself. So
he flapped his wings and jumped up and
down and around the rooster.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_54" id="p_54">p. 54</a></span></p>

<p>The rooster was very ill at ease. But
he didn't let Turkey Proudfoot know
that. He kept turning about, so that he
faced Turkey Proudfoot all the time.
And he said to Henrietta Hen: "Gather
your chicks and get them out of the way.
There's going to be trouble here."</p>

<p>Henrietta Hen obeyed him without a
word. And she had no sooner shooed her
youngsters into the chicken house than
Turkey Proudfoot gave a loud laugh&mdash;a
somewhat forced, yet loud laugh.</p>

<p>"You're just the sort of bird I like,"
he told the rooster. "I've been testing
you to see if you were brave. I'm delighted
to find that you are. And I suggest
that you and I stand by each other
and run things in this yard to suit ourselves.
When folks don't do as I tell
them to, you and I will attend to them."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" cried the rooster. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_55" id="p_55">p. 55</a></span>
greatly flattered. "We'll make the
neighbors step lively." And off he went,
to find Henrietta Hen and tell her how he
and Turkey Proudfoot were going to help
each other.</p>

<p>"You're even sillier than I supposed,"
she informed the rooster, to his great astonishment.
He had expected nothing
but praise from her.</p>

<p>He left her hurriedly. And he felt
quite glum.</p>

<p>"She's just like the whole Hen family,"
he grumbled. "You never can tell what
they're going to do or what they're going
to say. They may squawk and cross the
road; they may cross the road and not
squawk; they may squawk and not cross
the road; they may not cross the road and
not squawk. I don't believe they know
themselves what they are going to do
next."</p>

<h3>MR. CROW'S NEWS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no denying that the rooster at
Farmer Green's place had handsome tail
feathers. But they were as nothing, compared
with Turkey Proudfoot's. Not
only were the rooster's fewer in number;
but he couldn't spread them, fan-fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. Grouse, who lived in the woods, beyond
the pasture, could spread his tail.
But he was a much smaller bird than
Turkey Proudfoot and his tail wasn't
nearly as big.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot often remarked that
he had no rival. To be sure, there were
young gobblers on the farm. But in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_57" id="p_57">p. 57</a></span>
matter of tails, Turkey Proudfoot outshone
them all.</p>

<p>Farmer Green once had another turkey
cock that bade fair to have as fine a tail
as Turkey Proudfoot's. And for a time
this gentleman made Turkey Proudfoot
feel a bit uneasy.</p>

<p>"I'll have to fight him and pull out some
of his tail feathers," Turkey Proudfoot
decided.</p>

<p>But on the very day, in the fall, when
Turkey Proudfoot intended to pick a
quarrel with this person&mdash;and spoil his
fatal beauty&mdash;he was missing. And oddly
enough, nobody ever saw him around the
farmyard again.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot went so far as to
hint that he had scared the fellow away.
Not many believed that that was what happened,
however. For old dog Spot
claimed to have seen one of the missing<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_58" id="p_58">p. 58</a></span>
gobbler's wings hanging in the kitchen of
the farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Green uses it for a brush," Spot
had explained.</p>

<p>When he heard that story Turkey
Proudfoot exclaimed, "Nonsense! A
Fox's tail is a brush. But a Turkey's
wing is a wing. Old dog Spot doesn't
know what he's talking about. No doubt
Mrs. Green has a Fox's brush hanging up
beside her kitchen range."</p>

<p>Still, most of the farmyard folks insisted
that the missing gobbler had met
with an accident. Anyhow, the question
as to what had become of him didn't
trouble Turkey Proudfoot. The fellow
was gone. And there wasn't another
young gobbler on the farm that was likely
to have a tail out of the ordinary. So
Turkey Proudfoot was content.</p>

<p>His peace of mind lasted only a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_59" id="p_59">p. 59</a></span>
days. He was ranging through the
meadow one morning when he heard a
great commotion in the farmyard. Old
Mr. Crow soon came sailing over from the
edge of the woods to see what was the
matter. And after a while he went sailing
back again. On his way he stopped
to drop down into the meadow and speak
to Turkey Proudfoot.</p>

<p>"You ought to hurry home," Mr. Crow
croaked. "Johnnie Green has a new pet.
You ought to see him."</p>

<p>"Johnnie Green's pets don't interest
me," Turkey Proudfoot sniffed. "He's
never owned a pet yet that had a tail worth
looking at twice. As for his Guinea Pigs&mdash;well,
they haven't tails that you could
look at even once. They haven't any tails
at all. I must say I don't admire Johnnie
Green's taste in pets," said Turkey
Proudfoot.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_60" id="p_60">p. 60</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! This one is different," Mr.
Crow told him with a hoarse laugh.
"When you see his tail you'll fold yours
up in a hurry. And you'll never spread
it again."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried Turkey Proudfoot.
"Impossible!" He was so angry
with Mr. Crow that he couldn't say anything
more.</p>

<p>For all that, he strode away towards
the farmyard. And he had a most uneasy
feeling under his wishbone.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<h3>THE NEW PET</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Turkey Proudfoot</span> came hurrying back
to the farmyard from the meadow where
Mr. Crow had stopped and advised him to
go home and see Johnnie Green's new pet.</p>

<p>When Turkey Proudfoot scurried
around the barn he found everybody all
a-flutter. No one paid any attention to
Turkey Proudfoot, though he spread his
tail and strutted up to his neighbors with
a most important air.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" Turkey
Proudfoot demanded in his most lordly
tone.</p>

<p>Henrietta Hen went out of her way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_62" id="p_62">p. 62</a></span>
answer him. "Johnnie Green has a new
pet," she explained. "He's a wonderful
creature."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of him," said the
rooster. He had a surly look, as if something&mdash;perhaps
a pebble&mdash;had stuck in
his crop.</p>

<p>"I can't quite swallow this new pet,"
the rooster told Turkey Proudfoot.</p>

<p>"Ah! You haven't seen him with his
tail spread!" Henrietta Hen exclaimed.
"His tail is simply gorgeous."</p>

<p>His tail! That was exactly what old
Mr. Crow had mentioned. "Oh, well!"
Turkey Proudfoot thought. "I'm foolish
to be stirred up over this affair. The
new pet's tail can't be as grand as mine.
There's nothing for me to worry about."</p>

<p>But there was. What Henrietta Hen
said with her next breath made Turkey
Proudfoot miserable.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_63" id="p_63">p. 63</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd better put down your tail," she
advised him.</p>

<p>"Put down my tail!" he squawked.
"Anybody would think you were talking
about an umbrella. What's wrong with
my tail, madam? I hope you don't think
I'm ashamed of it."</p>

<p>"I fear you will be, when you see
Johnnie Green's new pet," Henrietta Hen
rattled on. "You'll want to hide your
tail then."</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Turkey Proudfoot
sternly. "You have said too much."</p>

<p>"Good!" the rooster chimed in. "I
agree with you. She always talks too
much." Once such a remark about Henrietta
Hen would have made the rooster
angry. Now, however, it pleased him.</p>

<p>"I know what's the matter with you,"
Henrietta Hen told the rooster. "Your
nose is out of joint."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_64" id="p_64">p. 64</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said the rooster.
"My nose&mdash;and by that no doubt you mean
my bill&mdash;is <i>not</i> out of joint."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes it is!" she insisted. "And
Turkey Proudfoot's will be out of joint
too, as soon as he sees the newcomer."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" Turkey Proudfoot suddenly
demanded. "Let me have a look at
him! I'll soon show <i>him</i> whether there's
anything wrong with my bill." He
puffed himself up and looked very fierce.</p>

<p>To his amazement, Henrietta Hen only
laughed.</p>

<p>"Tell that to the new pet!" she said.
"You'll find him in front of the farmhouse."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot didn't thank her.
He was so angry that he was almost choking.
And he strode off with a gleam in
his eyes that the younger gobblers knew
only too well&mdash;and feared.</p>

<p>On the lawn before Farmer Green's
house Turkey Proudfoot saw such a
sight as he had never expected to behold.
A big bird stood proudly on the grass plot,
looking for all the world as if he owned
not only the house, but the whole farm.
His colors were like the blues and greens
of a rainbow. And behind him he carried
aloft a tail that made Turkey Proudfoot
all but ill with envy.</p>

<p>"Who-who-who is this person?"
Turkey Proudfoot gasped, turning to old
dog Spot.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" said Spot. "He's
Johnnie Green's new pet. He's the Peacock."</p>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_66" id="p_66">p. 66</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<h3>A PROUD PERSON</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> peacock in front of the farmhouse
paid no heed to Turkey Proudfoot, but
moved very slowly and very haughtily
about the lawn. His huge tail was spread
like a sail. In the light summer breeze
it swayed and rippled, sending out a thousand
shimmering gleams. And on his tail
were dozens of eyes. At least they looked
like eyes to Turkey Proudfoot. And they
all seemed to be trying to out-stare him.</p>

<p>For a minute or two Turkey Proudfoot
glared at this newcomer&mdash;this new pet of
Johnnie Green's. Then, after first
spreading his own tail to its fullest size,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_67" id="p_67">p. 67</a></span>
he swaggered up to the peacock.</p>

<p>"You needn't pretend not to see me,"
Turkey Proudfoot gobbled. "You can't
fool me. You've a hundred eyes on your
tail. And they've been looking at me
steadily."</p>

<p>The peacock calmly turned his head and
glanced at Turkey Proudfoot. He did
not answer.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot thrust his own head
forward.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm not good enough for you
to speak to," he began. "Maybe I'm not
enough of a dandy&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then somebody interrupted him.
It was Henrietta Hen. Being a prying
sort of person she had followed Turkey
Proudfoot around the house to see what
happened when he and the newcomer met.</p>

<p>"Don't be rude to this gentleman," said
Henrietta Hen. "He hasn't spoken<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_68" id="p_68">p. 68</a></span>
since he arrived in the wagon an hour ago.
We've about decided that he is dumb.
And it's a great pity if he is. No doubt
his voice&mdash;if he had one&mdash;would be as
beautiful as his tail."</p>

<p>At that the peacock opened his mouth.
Out of it there came the harshest sounds
that had ever been heard on the farm.
Turkey Proudfoot was so startled that he
threw his head into the air and took several
steps backward. As for Henrietta
Hen, she cackled in terror and ran out of
the yard and crossed the road, where she
narrowly escaped being run over by a
passing wagon.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Turkey Proudfoot
thought. "It's no wonder this Peacock
doesn't talk much. If I had a voice like
his I'd never use it." He didn't know
what the peacock had said. Somehow his
voice was so awful that Turkey Proudfoot<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_69" id="p_69">p. 69</a></span>
had caught no actual words that
meant anything to him.</p>

<p>Again the peacock screamed. Henrietta
Hen heard him. And she was so
flustered that she ran back and forth
across the road three times and was almost
trampled on by a horse.</p>

<p>At last Turkey Proudfoot understood
what the peacock said. "Are you a
barnyard fowl?" he had asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," said Turkey Proudfoot.
"Aren't you?"</p>

<p>"No!" the peacock replied. "My
place is out here in front of the house
where people can see me when they drive
by.... Probably," he added, "we shan't
see much of each other."</p>

<p>So saying, he walked stiffly away and
mounted the stone wall, where passing
travellers would be sure to notice him and
admire his beauty.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_70" id="p_70">p. 70</a></span></p>

<p>All this was a terrible blow to Turkey
Proudfoot. For a moment he was
tempted to rush at the haughty stranger
and tear his handsome feathers into tatters.
But the peacock looked so huge,
standing on top of the wall with his great
tail rising above him, and his voice was
so frightfully loud and harsh, that Turkey
Proudfoot didn't even dare threaten him.
And that was something unusual for one
who had long claimed to be ruler of the
farmyard.</p>

<h3>MRS. WREN'S ADVICE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Turkey Proudfoot</span> never knew that the
peacock was no bigger than he was. The
elegant creature had such a huge tail and
such a loud, harsh voice that Turkey
Proudfoot stood in great awe of him.</p>

<p>Being very peevish, after his first meeting
with the peacock, Turkey Proudfoot
went behind the barn and found a young
gobbler and gave him a terrible drubbing.
Then Turkey Proudfoot felt better.</p>

<p>That night he roosted in a tree near the
farmhouse. And in the morning when he
awoke no thought of the peacock entered
his head. He indulged in a few early<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_72" id="p_72">p. 72</a></span>
morning gobbles&mdash;according to his custom&mdash;when
a rasping scream reminded
him of his hated rival. The peacock had
slept in another tree not far away, even
nearer the farmhouse than Turkey Proudfoot's.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Turkey Proudfoot.
"Farmer Green won't care for that racket
every morning just outside his window.
And neither will Rusty Wren. He always
goes to the trouble of waking
Farmer Green with his singing. This
new pet of Johnnie's has taken it upon
himself to do Rusty's work."</p>

<p>It was true that Rusty Wren was upset.
He scolded a good deal to his wife
that day about the peacock.</p>

<p>"There's no use of my singing a dawn
song beneath Farmer Green's window any
more," Rusty Wren grumbled. "The
terrible squalls of this new bird will disturb<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_73" id="p_73">p. 73</a></span>
everybody in the valley."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly!" said Mrs. Wren.
"Don't be silly like Turkey Proudfoot.
He's making himself miserable because
the Peacock has a tail that sticks up
higher than his. How absurd," she cried,
"to be proud like Turkey Proudfoot, just
because your tail happens to stick up in
the air. Why, yours and mine stick up.
But we don't go around boasting about
them. And if somebody else has a stickier-up
tail, why worry about it? And if
somebody else with a louder voice can
wake Farmer Green better than you can,
why worry about that? Let the Peacock
scream if he wants to!"</p>

<p>"And <i>I</i>&mdash;" cried Turkey Proudfoot,
who had been standing beneath the tree
where Mr. and Mrs. Wren were talking&mdash;"<i>I</i> say,
let the Peacock parade in the
front yard if he wants to. I certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_74" id="p_74">p. 74</a></span>
shan't visit him there. I'll parade behind
the farmhouse."</p>

<p>When Turkey Proudfoot first spoke up
like that, Rusty Wren and his wife gave
each other an uneasy look. They had expected
him to be angry. And now, with
an air of great relief, Mrs. Wren exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I apologize to you, Mr. Turkey Proudfoot.
You're not as silly as I supposed.
You're not as vain as I thought you were.
I begin to think we've been mistaken
about you all these years."</p>

<p>"You certainly have been," Turkey
Proudfoot declared. "I'm not vain at all
and I'm glad I haven't the Peacock's horrid,
harsh voice. Mine is much more
beautiful than his. And nobody can
deny it."</p>

<p>"<i>Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble!</i>"</p>

<h3>DRUMMING ON A LOG</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Turkey Proudfoot</span> was not always content
to stay in the farmyard. Although
Farmer Green fed him well, he liked to
range over the fields in search of extra
tidbits, such as grain, seeds and insects.
Sometimes he wandered even as far as the
pasture. And one day he strayed into the
edge of the woods beyond the pasture
fence.</p>

<p>There he discovered a beech tree. And
Turkey Proudfoot was enjoying the nuts
that he found on the ground beneath it
when all at once a <i>thump-thump-thump</i>
startled him. He raised his head and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_76" id="p_76">p. 76</a></span>
listened. The thumping sound came
faster and faster, then died away in a
rumble.</p>

<p>"Ho! It's only Johnnie Green drumming.
Probably his mother wouldn't let
him drum near the farmhouse, so he came
to the woods where she couldn't hear
him."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot paid no more heed
to the drumming, which rolled through
the woods now and then. He went on
with his search for beechnuts. But at
last a thought popped into his head.
"Johnnie Green must be eating most of
the time, or he'd drum oftener," Turkey
Proudfoot muttered. "He must have
found a beech tree."</p>

<p>Soon Turkey Proudfoot decided to
join Johnnie Green. He hoped that
beechnuts were more plentiful beneath
Johnnie's tree. So Turkey Proudfoot<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_77" id="p_77">p. 77</a></span>
picked his way slowly through the underbrush.
And guided by the <i>thump-thump-thump</i>
which once in a while boomed upon
his ears, at last Turkey Proudfoot came
into a little clearing.</p>

<p>There on a log sat a speckly, feathered,
short-necked gentleman with a tail spread
in much the fashion in which Turkey
Proudfoot so often carried his own.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot drew back behind a
bush, out of sight.</p>

<p>"I'll show that bird a tail that <i>is</i> a tail,"
he muttered to himself. So he spread his
tail and then stepped proudly forth. A
dry twig snapped beneath his weight. At
that sound the stranger on the log
turned his head quickly. Just for an
instant there was an eager look on his
face. But when he beheld Turkey
Proudfoot it changed to one of disappointment.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_78" id="p_78">p. 78</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" the stranger asked in
none too pleasant a tone.</p>

<p>"I'm Turkey Proudfoot," said the ruler
of the farmyard. "I live down the hill
at Farmer Green's place."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better go home where you
belong," said the stranger on the log. "I
was expecting some one. I've been drumming
for a friend. And when I heard
you step on that dry twig I thought she'd
come. I had my tail spread in her
honor."</p>

<p>"Drum again!" Turkey Proudfoot ordered.
"Call your friend at once and I'll
show her a tail that is a tail. Yours is
no bigger than Mrs. Green's fan."</p>

<p>The stranger made no move to obey.
He appeared somewhat sulky.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" Turkey Proudfoot
demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm Mr. Grouse," the stranger<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_79" id="p_79">p. 79</a></span>
snapped out. "I supposed everybody in
Pleasant Valley knew me. My drumming
is famous."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Turkey Proudfoot.
"I thought it was Johnnie Green making
that noise."</p>

<p>"No wonder!" Mr. Grouse sniffed.
"You're only a barnyard fowl. You
can't be expected to know anything about
us game birds."</p>

<h3>A GAME BIRD</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grouse</span> moved back and forth upon
his log in the clearing in the woods. And
casting a withering glance at Turkey
Proudfoot, he said, "It's plain that you
don't know what a game bird is. Men&mdash;and
boys, too&mdash;come into the woods with
guns to hunt us. And we make game of
them by rising swiftly with a loud <i>whir</i>
and flying off before they have time to
shoot us."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot gaped at Mr. Grouse.</p>

<p>"Don't they ever hit you?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"They've never shot me," said Mr.
Grouse. "Once a hunter knocked out one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_81" id="p_81">p. 81</a></span>of my tail feathers. But that was only
an accident."</p>

</div>

<p>"I shouldn't care to be a game bird,"
Turkey Proudfoot remarked. "I'm sure
it's much safer living at the farmyard."</p>

<p>Mr. Grouse gave him an odd look. One
winter when food was scarce in the woods
he had flown down to the farmyard. And
he remembered seeing turkey feathers
scattered about the chopping block near
the woodpile.</p>

<p>"How do you usually spend the holidays?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Last Fourth of July I went up in the
haymow and kept out of sight all day,"
said Turkey Proudfoot. "I don't like
firecrackers."</p>

<p>Mr. Grouse nodded his head.</p>

<p>"I don't blame you for that," he observed.
"Firecrackers sound too much
like guns.... But I wasn't thinking of<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_82" id="p_82">p. 82</a></span>
the Fourth of July," he went on. "When
I asked how you spent the holidays I was
thinking more of those to come. Now,
Thanksgiving Day isn't a long way off.
Have you made any plans for that?"</p>

<p>When he mentioned Thanksgiving Day
Turkey Proudfoot gave a sudden start.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, don't speak of that
now!" he cried. "I came to the woods
to enjoy myself. And now you're trying
to spoil my good time."</p>

<p>Mr. Grouse could see that Turkey
Proudfoot was angry. And being rather
peppery himself, he was tempted to say
something sharp&mdash;something about <i>axes</i>,
which are always sharp unless they're
dull. But Mr. Grouse managed to control
his temper. After all, he thought, it was
no wonder that Turkey Proudfoot didn't
want to hear about Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>"Pardon me!" said Mr. Grouse. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_83" id="p_83">p. 83</a></span>
only brought up this matter in a cousinly
kind of way."</p>

<p>"Cousinly!" cried Turkey Proudfoot.
"You and I, sir, are total strangers to each
other."</p>

<p>"Well, we ought not to be," said Mr.
Grouse. "It's time we got acquainted
with each other. Didn't you know that
your family and mine are related?"</p>

<p>"No!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed.
"No! I never knew it."</p>

<p>"It's the truth," Mr. Grouse told him.
"Don't you think we look a bit alike, except
that my neck is somewhat short, and
yours is long and skinny? And of course
my head is feathered out, while yours is
bald and red."</p>

<p>"That will do!" Turkey Proudfoot
gobbled angrily. "Even if you are my
cousin you needn't make such remarks
about me."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_84" id="p_84">p. 84</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Grouse begged his pardon again.</p>

<p>"I was only pointing out the differences
between us," he explained. "But if they
displease you, I'll speak of the ways in
which we are alike. Now, take our
tails&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't!" Turkey Proudfoot squalled.
"I'll take my own tail wherever I go.
But I won't take yours."</p>

<h3>RED LIGHTNING</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What's</span> the matter with my tail!" cried
Mr. Grouse.</p>

<p>"It's too small," Turkey Proudfoot declared.
"Now, if you want to see a tail
that <i>is</i> a tail&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't!" cried Mr. Grouse. "Not if
you want me to look at yours! In fact, I
don't care to talk with you any more. I
was going to suggest a pleasant way for
you to spend Thanksgiving Day. But
nothing I say seems to please you. Besides,
you began to boast about your tail
the moment you entered this clearing.
And if there's anybody I can't endure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_86" id="p_86">p. 86</a></span>
it's a boaster." He was a rough and
ready sort of fellow&mdash;this Mr. Grouse.
When he had anything to say he didn't go
beating about the bush. He came right
out in the open and spoke his mind freely.</p>

<p>You might think that Turkey Proudfoot
would have taken his cousin's remarks
to heart. But he didn't. He was
so pleased with his own tail that to him it
was the biggest thing in the world. Indeed,
when he spread his tail and looked
at it he could see nothing else.</p>

<p>"You are jealous," he told Mr. Grouse.
"And I can't blame you. It's only natural
that you should look at my tail with
envy. Everybody does down at the farmyard."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot must have forgotten
all about the peacock, when he spoke.
Anyhow, he gazed around at his tail with
great admiration.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_87" id="p_87">p. 87</a></span></p>

<p>All at once there was a terrible, loud
<i>whirring</i> sound. Turkey Proudfoot
started up in alarm. To his amazement,
where Mr. Grouse had been sitting on the
log there was now nothing at all.</p>

<p>"Up! Up!" It was Mr. Grouse's
voice that Turkey Proudfoot heard; and
it seemed to come from the tree right
above his head.</p>

<p>Although Turkey Proudfoot didn't like
to obey anybody's orders&mdash;and certainly
not Mr. Grouse's&mdash;there was a note of
alarm in the cry that made him squall with
terror. He started to run, flapping his
wings awkwardly. And just as he rose
into the air a reddish, brownish streak
flashed beneath him.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot settled himself on a
branch of an old oak and looked down at
a sharp-faced, grinning person who leered
up at him. It was Tommy Fox. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_88" id="p_88">p. 88</a></span>
though he looked very pleasant, inside he
was feeling quite peevish. If it hadn't
been for Mr. Grouse's warning he would
surely have captured Turkey Proudfoot.</p>

<p>It was like Turkey Proudfoot not to
thank his cousin. And it was like him,
too, to fly into a rage.</p>

<p>"You might have warned me sooner,"
he complained to Mr. Grouse. "That red
rascal is quick as lightning. He almost
caught me."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd follow me when you
saw me rise," said Mr. Grouse.</p>

<p>"I didn't see you."</p>

<p>"Well, you <i>heard</i> me, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I heard a <i>whirring</i> sound," said
Turkey Proudfoot, "but I didn't know
what it was."</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" cried Mr. Grouse.
"Farmer Green ought not to let you come
into the woods&mdash;not if he expects you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_89" id="p_89">p. 89</a></span>
spend Thanksgiving Day with him!"</p>

<p>Tommy Fox chuckled at that remark.</p>

<p>But Turkey Proudfoot never let on that
he heard it. He crouched lower upon the
limb of the oak tree and pretended to fall
asleep.</p>

<p>Daylight was fast fading.</p>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_90" id="p_90">p. 90</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX</h2>

<h3>NIGHT IN THE WOODS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grouse</span> and Tommy Fox soon went
about their business, leaving Turkey
Proudfoot to roost in the oak tree in the
woods.</p>

<p>Though he pretended to be fast asleep,
Turkey Proudfoot had kept one eye
slightly open. He had seen Tommy Fox
trot away toward the pasture. He had
heard Mr. Grouse go <i>whirring</i> off into the
depths of the woods.</p>

<p>"It's too late to go back to the farmyard
this evening," Turkey Proudfoot
grumbled. "It's almost dusk already.
And there's no telling about Tommy Fox.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_91" id="p_91">p. 91</a></span>
He may be hiding behind a tree, ready to
pounce on me the moment I alight on the
ground."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot actually began to
feel a bit sleepy. He was in the habit of
going early to roost anyhow. So he
huddled low on the branch of the oak tree.
And soon he was in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>He slept a long time. And while he
slept a number of things happened of
which he knew nothing.</p>

<p>Tommy Fox came stealing back in the
moonlight and gazed up at him with longing
eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Kitty Cat, who had prowled
through the pasture on a hunt for field
mice, spied him. "I declare, that's
Turkey Proudfoot!" she exclaimed. "He
must have got lost up here. I certainly
shan't wake him and tell him the way
home. If I spoke to him he'd be sure to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_92" id="p_92">p. 92</a></span>
gobble and scare away all the mice in the
neighborhood."</p>

<p>Benjamin Bat came zigzagging through
the air and all but blundered into Turkey
Proudfoot. Missing him by the breadth
of a wing, Benjamin Bat hung head downward
from a near-by limb and stared
at the sleeping form. "Hello!" he
squeaked. "Here's a newcomer in these
woods. I should think he'd cling to that
limb upside down. He'd find it a much
safer way than sitting on top of the
limb." Benjamin Bat was on the point
of rousing Turkey Proudfoot and advising
him to change his position when a
quavering whistle sent Benjamin hurrying
away. He knew the voice of Simon
Screecher, Solomon Owl's small cousin.
And he had no wish to meet him.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot stirred in his sleep.
He was dreaming&mdash;dreaming that Johnnie<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_93" id="p_93">p. 93</a></span>
Green was whistling to old dog Spot to
come and drive Turkey Proudfoot out of
the newly planted cornfield. The whistling
seemed to come nearer and nearer.
"I won't stir for old Spot," Turkey
Proudfoot gobbled aloud in his sleep.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'll stir for me," cried a
strange voice. And Turkey Proudfoot
woke up with a start.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he bawled. For a moment
he couldn't remember having gone
to sleep in the woods.</p>

<p>"You're right up under Blue Mountain,"
said Simon Screecher. "It's a
dangerous place for a stranger to sleep.
There are birds and beasts a-plenty in
these woods that would make a meal of
you if they caught you here."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot yawned.</p>

<p>"I'm not worrying," he replied.
"Foxes can't climb trees. And I'm as<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_94" id="p_94">p. 94</a></span>
big as any bird in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"You're as big&mdash;yes! And bigger than
most!" Simon Screecher admitted. "But
it isn't bigness alone that counts in the
woods," he insisted.</p>

<p>"What does count, then?" Turkey</p>

<p>Proudfoot demanded.</p>

<p>"You ought to be able to guess," said
Simon Screecher. "It's right in front of
your eyes."</p>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_95" id="p_95">p. 95</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX</h2>

<h3>BEAKS AND BILLS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Turkey Proudfoot</span> was a poor guesser.
There in the woods, at night, Simon
Screecher the owl had told him of something
that "counted," something that was
right in front of Turkey Proudfoot's eyes.
And Turkey Proudfoot named everything
he could think of. He mentioned the oak
tree in which he sat, the darkness, the yellow
moon.</p>

<p>"You're wrong!" Simon Screecher
kept telling him. "You're getting further
away with every guess. I suppose
I'll have to tell you what I mean: it's your
beak. And if that isn't right in front of<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_96" id="p_96">p. 96</a></span>
your eyes, I don't know what is."</p>

<p>"My beak!" cried Turkey Proudfoot.
"I don't call my bill my beak. I call my
beak my bill."</p>

<p>"Well, beak or bill, yours is a useless
thing," Simon Screecher sneered. "It
may do well enough to pick up a kernel of
corn. But it can't be much good as a
weapon. It ought to be sharp and hooked
to be of any use in a fight."</p>

<p>With every word that Simon Screecher
said, Turkey Proudfoot was growing
angrier.</p>

<p>"There's nothing wrong with my bill,"
he clamored. "I've had plenty of fights
in the farmyard. The fowls are all afraid
of me at home."</p>

<p>Simon Screecher gave a most disagreeable
laugh.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of farmyard fights,"
he sniffed. "If Fatty Coon or Grumpy<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_97" id="p_97">p. 97</a></span>
Weasel or my cousin Solomon Owl
grabbed you, you'd find that a fight in the
woods is a very different matter from a
mere barnyard squabble."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot was furious.</p>

<p>"If you'll come over here on this limb
I'll peck you," he cried.</p>

<p>"Huh! We don't fight that way in the
woods," Simon Screecher retorted. "We
don't peck. We tear-r-r-r!"</p>

<p>He rolled out the last word in a long-drawn
quaver which gave it a horrid
sound&mdash;especially in the woods, after
dark. And Turkey Proudfoot felt chills
a-running up and down his back.</p>

<p>"A-ahem! You-you needn't bother to
come over here," he stammered. "I-I
shouldn't like to peck you. You-er-you
seem to be a very pleasant sort of person."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not!" Simon Screecher informed
him. "And you ought to see my<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_98" id="p_98">p. 98</a></span>
cousin, Solomon Owl. He's a <i>terrible</i>
fellow."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot's wishbone seemed
to be trying to come up into his month.
At least, he had to swallow several times
before he could answer.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see your cousin," he replied,
"but not to-night."</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when
a loud call came booming through the
woods: "<i>Whooo-whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo,
to-whoo-ah!</i>"</p>

<p>"Who's that?" gasped Turkey Proudfoot.</p>

<p>"That's my cousin, Solomon Owl,"
Simon Screecher explained. "And he's
not far away."</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed.
"If he's as big as his voice he
must be enormous."</p>

<p>"He's twice my size," said Simon<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_99" id="p_99">p. 99</a></span>
Screecher. "Not nearly as big as you
are, of course! But you ought to see his
beak. I do believe he could tear you
into&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to see him to-night,"
Turkey Proudfoot interrupted. "I hope
he won't come this way. Go and find
him. And tell him to meet me here <i>to-morrow</i>
night."</p>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_100" id="p_100">p. 100</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI</h2>

<h3>FARMYARD MANNERS</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, very well!" said Simon Screecher
to Turkey Proudfoot. "I'll give my
cousin your message. I'll tell him that
you want him to meet you here in this
clearing in the woods to-morrow night."
So off Simon Screecher flew.</p>

<p>He had not been gone long when a noisy
"<i>haw-haw-hoo-hoo</i>" rolled and echoed
through the woods.</p>

<p>"He's laughing!" Turkey Proudfoot
exclaimed. "Solomon Owl is laughing.
I wonder what the joke is." He was so
curious to know that he actually began to
wish that Simon Screecher would hurry<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_101" id="p_101">p. 101</a></span>
back. And after a little while he did.</p>

<p>"What was the joke?" Turkey Proudfoot
demanded. "I heard you cousin
laughing."</p>

<p>"Solomon Owl says that he doesn't care
to meet you at all," Simon Screecher explained.
"He says he has heard about
you before and that you're a tough old
bird."</p>

<p>"I'm not!" Turkey shrieked. "I'm
very tender&mdash;and I'm not ten years old."</p>

<p>"Solomon Owl says he doesn't care to
bother with any but the very youngest
Turkeys."</p>

<p>"Well," Turkey Proudfoot retorted,
"no matter what he says, the joke's on
him. I wasn't coming back here to-morrow
night. I don't like sleeping in the
woods and having my rest disturbed by
hoots and whistles."</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't," Simon<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_102" id="p_102">p. 102</a></span>
Screecher admitted. "And I shouldn't
care to try to sleep at the farmyard in the
daytime and he waked by gobbles."</p>

<p>"I wish you <i>would</i> come down to the
farmyard," Turkey Proudfoot told him.
"You'd drive old dog Spot half crazy with
your whistling."</p>

<p>Simon Screecher looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"No!" he said. "Farmer Green might
drive me half crazy with his old shotgun."
He yawned as he spoke. "I don't see
what's making me so sleepy," he remarked.
"I must be going home."</p>

<p>"Don't hurry!" Turkey Proudfoot
begged him. "I'm beginning to enjoy
your company&mdash;though I can't exactly
say why. And I'd like to gabble with you
for an hour or two. I don't see what
makes me so wakeful."</p>

<p>Just then a familiar sound greeted
Turkey Proudfoot's ears. It was a crow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_103" id="p_103">p. 103</a></span>
It was the rooster's crow, way down at the
farmyard.</p>

<p>"Why, it's almost dawn!" Turkey
Proudfoot exclaimed. "I didn't know
the night was so nearly gone. It's no
wonder I couldn't sleep. The dawn of
another day always makes one wide
awake."</p>

<p>"It always makes one sleepy, you
mean," Simon Screecher corrected him.</p>

<p>Now, Turkey Proudfoot always grew
angry when anybody corrected him in any
way. And he flew into a rage.</p>

<p>"Go away! Go home!" he spluttered.
"I don't enjoy your company."</p>

<p>Simon Screecher started homewards at
once.</p>

<p>"Farmyard manners!" he muttered.
"I declare, I wish Cousin Solomon hadn't
eaten those two mice and those three frogs
and those four spiders and those five<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_104" id="p_104">p. 104</a></span>
grasshoppers to-night. When he's well
fed he's always good-natured. If he had
been hungry he'd have been in a terrible
temper. And he'd have fought this
Turkey bird until there was nothing left
of him but his tail feathers."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot never knew what a
narrow escape he had. As soon as it began
to grow light he dropped down out
of the oak tree and hurried home, for he
didn't want to miss the breakfast that
Farmer Green always gave him.</p>

<p>Along in the fall, breakfasts always
seemed to be bigger.</p>

<h3>CRANBERRY SAUCE</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ho</span>, hum!" old Mr. Crow yawned. He
had stopped to talk with Turkey Proudfoot
in the cornfield. It was fall; and
the shocks of corn stood on every hand
like great fat scarecrows, with fat yellow
pumpkins lying at their feet, as if the
scarecrows' heads had fallen off.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow always yawned a good deal
when he chatted with Turkey Proudfoot
and he wasn't always as careful as he
might have been about covering up his
yawns. Somehow Mr. Crow found
Turkey Proudfoot dull company. Turkey
Proudfoot had never been off the farm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_106" id="p_106">p. 106</a></span>
On the other hand, old Mr. Crow was a
great traveller. In his younger days he
used to spend every winter in the South.
And though he felt that the long journey
had become too hard for him now, he
thought nothing of flying around Blue
Mountain and up and down Pleasant
Valley.</p>

<p>As a result of his wanderings Mr. Crow
had learned many things. And as a result
of his staying at home, Turkey Proudfoot
had learned little or nothing. Often
Turkey Proudfoot complained to Mr.
Crow that he couldn't even understand
what Mr. Crow was talking about. But
on this occasion Mr. Crow mentioned
something that made him shudder.</p>

<p>"Ho, hum!" Mr. Crow yawned again.
"My appetite isn't what it used to be. I
believe I need to eat something tart. So
I think I'll go over to the cranberry bog<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_107" id="p_107">p. 107</a></span>
and pick a few cranberries. Why don't
you come along with me?"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed.
"Cranberries! I can't stand even the
mention of them."</p>

<p>"Ha!" Mr. Crow murmured to himself.
"I've waked him up at last. I thought
that would fetch him." And to Turkey
Proudfoot he said, "Do you mean to tell
me that you don't like cranberries?
Why, I've always heard Turkey and
cranberry sauce mentioned together."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Turkey Proudfoot. "I've
no doubt you've heard them spoken of
only too often. But that's no reason why
I should be fond of cranberry sauce. To
tell the truth, all my life I've schemed to
keep away from it."</p>

<p>"Then you don't care for the sharp
taste of cranberries," said Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>"I've never eaten any," Turkey Proud<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_108" id="p_108">p. 108</a></span>foot
told him. "I'm sure I couldn't eat
any if I wanted to. I believe the sight of
them would take my appetite away."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow shook his head. And he
leaned over to pick up a stray kernel of
corn.</p>

<p>"Don't take that!" Turkey Proudfoot
warned him. "I've had my eye on that
kernel. I was going to eat it as soon as
you went away."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow bolted the kernel of corn
in a twinkling.</p>

<p>"You forget that you're not in the
farmyard," he said boldly. "You can't
treat me as if I were a Hen." And he
chuckled&mdash;in a croaking sort of fashion.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot glared at him. He
knew that it was useless to rush at Mr.
Crow. The old gentleman would only
rise into the air and sail away with a loud
haw-haw.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_109" id="p_109">p. 109</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Mr. Crow was a famous tease.
He dearly loved to annoy others. And he
gave Turkey Proudfoot a sly glance.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" he exclaimed. "I have a
twinge of rheumatism."</p>

<p>"Where is your pain?" asked Turkey
Proudfoot.</p>

<p>"In one of my drumsticks," said old
Mr. Crow promptly, with a spluttering
cough, to keep from laughing.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot was furious.</p>

<p>"Cranberry sauce and drumsticks!" he
exclaimed. "You do choose the most
painful things to talk about."</p>

<p>"I was only trying to be polite," Mr.
Crow told him. "You're always complaining
that I don't talk about matters
you can understand."</p>

<p>"I understand these only too well&mdash;"
Turkey Proudfoot said&mdash;"especially at
this season of the year!"</p>

<h3>VACATION TIME</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was well along in November. And
Turkey Proudfoot was feeling fidgetty.
Whenever Farmer Green or the hired man
stepped into the yard, he started up with
a wild look in his eye.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot was no longer roosting
at night in the tree near the farmhouse.</p>

<p>With the coming of cold weather he had
been glad enough to roost under a shed beside
the barn.</p>

<p>Ever since the winter before, Turkey
Proudfoot had enjoyed sound sleeps at
night. But for weeks now he had often<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_111" id="p_111">p. 111</a></span>
waked up in the middle of the night and
found himself all a-shiver.</p>

<p>"It's the fault of that horrid old Mr.
Crow," Turkey Proudfoot complained to
old dog Spot one day. "He would talk
about cranberry sauce and drumsticks.
And of course a person can't sleep well
with such things on his mind."</p>

<p>Old dog Spot nodded.</p>

<p>"Isn't it about time for you to go on
your yearly vacation?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Don't talk so loud!" Turkey Proudfoot
hissed. And he took a quick glance
all around. Then he said to old dog Spot,
in almost a whisper, "To-morrow morning
I'll be missing. Now, don't tell anybody!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" Spot promised. "I'm
glad you're going away for a little change.
I've thought lately that you were getting
more peevish and quarrelsome than ever."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_112" id="p_112">p. 112</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not!" Turkey Proudfoot gobbled.
"I may be a bit excitable because I've lost
a good deal of sleep lately. But I'm as
good-natured as I ever was."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well!" said Spot. "I'll
admit all that. I certainly don't want to
quarrel with you just as you're going to
leave us for a while.... We shall miss
you while you're gone," he added with a
sly smile. "The place will seem very
quiet without your gobble."</p>

<p>"Yes, I dare say it will be lonesome
around here," Turkey Proudfoot agreed.
"And I suppose things will be in a muddle
in the farmyard by the time I get back,
with nobody to keep order there."</p>

<p>"I'll do the best I can while you're
away," old dog Spot promised.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot seemed doubtful that
Spot could take his place.</p>

<p>"Keep your tail still when you bark,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_113" id="p_113">p. 113</a></span>
he told the old dog. "These farmyard
fowls won't pay much attention to you if
they see your tail a-wagging."</p>

<p>"I'll remember what you say," Spot
answered.</p>

<p>"Be sure to keep a sharp eye on that
Rooster." Turkey Proudfoot went on. "I
don't want him to get the idea into his
head that he's running things in this,
farmyard."</p>

<p>"Very well!" said Spot. "Shall I let
him crow a bit, if he wants to?"</p>

<p>"Let him crow&mdash;yes!" Turkey Proudfoot
answered. "But if he starts to gobbling&mdash;well,
you'd better send for me at
once."</p>

<p>"What about the Peacock?" Spot inquired
wickedly. He knew that Turkey
Proudfoot was frightfully jealous of
Johnnie Green's newest pet.</p>

<p>"The Peacock!" Turkey Proudfoot<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_114" id="p_114">p. 114</a></span>
squawked. "Pull out his tail feathers&mdash;every
one of them! I've been intending
to do that myself. But I've been so busy
that I haven't had the time for it."</p>

<p>Then they said good-by.</p>

<p>"You ought to tell me where you're going,"
Spot suggested. "If the Rooster
should gobble I must know where to find
you."</p>

<p>So Turkey Proudfoot told him. He
told him in such a low tone that nobody
else could hear.</p>

<h3>BROTHER TOM</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was almost dark in the cornfield on a
crisp evening late in November. It was
not Farmer Green's field, but that of a
neighbor of his. And it was far from any
house.</p>

<p>The pumpkins had been gathered weeks
before. The cornstalks had long since
been cut and now stood in shocks amidst
the stubble.</p>

<p>On the whole, the scene was bleak and
dismal. Not a creature moved anywhere.
Even the meadow, mice had already found
the nights too chilly for their liking.
Turkey Proudfoot was there alone, standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_116" id="p_116">p. 116</a></span>
like a statue, as if he were waiting for
somebody.</p>

<p>"I don't see where he can be," Turkey
Proudfoot muttered. "I've spent three
days and three nights here already. And
he has never been late before in all the
years that I've been coming here for my
vacation."</p>

<p>At last Turkey Proudfoot bestirred
himself. With a hop, skip and a jump he
landed on top of the rail fence that surrounded
the field and settled himself for
the night.</p>

<p>He had scarcely closed his eyes when a
faint "<i>Gobble, gobble, gobble</i>" from
across the cornfield drove all idea of sleep
out of his head. He started up, stretched
his long neck as high as he could, and
burst forth with a deafening "<i>Gobble,
gobble, gobble!</i>" Then he paused and
listened.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_117" id="p_117">p. 117</a></span></p>

<p>The answer soon reached him. It was
nearer this time. And after Turkey
Proudfoot had repeated his interesting remark
about a dozen times a huge old
turkey cock came running up and alighted,
panting, upon the fence-rail where
Turkey Proudfoot was roosting.</p>

<p>"You're late," Turkey Proudfoot
greeted him. "I'd begun to fear that you
had met with an accident. What kept
you?"</p>

<p>"They shut me up in a pen," the newcomer
told him. He was still somewhat
out of breath, partly because of rage at
having been imprisoned, partly because
he had been hurrying. "They shut me up
two days ago," he explained.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed.
"You ought to have left home three days
ago. Did you forget our yearly meeting?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_118" id="p_118">p. 118</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" said the other. "But I must
have miscounted the days."</p>

<p>"That's very dangerous at this time of
year," Turkey Proudfoot replied. "It's
a wonder that you escaped from the pen.
How did you manage to slip out!"</p>

<p>"Somebody left the door ajar," said the
strange turkey.</p>

<p>"Ah! I've always claimed that our
family was lucky!" Turkey Proudfoot
cried. And he gave his companion a slap
on the back with his wing.</p>

<p>Now, that was a jolly thing to do&mdash;and
not at all like Turkey Proudfoot. But
he was glad to see the newcomer. They
were brothers. They had been separated
when quite young; and they had lived on
neighboring farms all their lives.</p>

<p>For a time they talked together pleasantly
enough. Of course Turkey Proudfoot
couldn't help boasting about the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_119" id="p_119">p. 119</a></span>
he ruled the roost when he was at home.
But his brother Tom was just as great a
boaster. And after a time each began to
think the other's stories somewhat tiresome.
So they began to yawn. And at
last they fell asleep.</p>

<p>A crescent moon peeped down at them
from a clear, cold sky that crackled with
stars. A chilling breeze swept down the
valley. And sometime during the night
Turkey Proudfoot woke up and found
himself a-shiver. He sidled along the
rail and huddled against his brother Tom.</p>

<p>Brother Tom stirred and stretched himself.</p>

<p>"This night's a nipper, isn't it?" he remarked.
"I can't help wishing my legs
were like Mr. Grouse's."</p>

<p>"Huh!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed.
"You'd look queer&mdash;as fat as you are&mdash;if
you had legs as short as his."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_120" id="p_120">p. 120</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! But his legs are feathered out.
And there's nothing like feathers to keep
the cold off," said Brother Tom.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Turkey Proudfoot,
"Mr. Grouse's legs wouldn't get as cold
as ours do, even if he hadn't a feather on
them."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Brother Tom.</p>

<p>"Because they're shorter," said Turkey
Proudfoot.</p>

<p>Brother Tom made no reply. He was
no longer awake.</p>

<p>Being on the leeward side of his
brother, Turkey Proudfoot began to feel
warmer.</p>

<p>"I'm glad Tom's a big fellow," he murmured
drowsily. "He makes a fine windbreak."
Then he too fell asleep.</p>

<p>And the next day was Thanksgiving.</p>
